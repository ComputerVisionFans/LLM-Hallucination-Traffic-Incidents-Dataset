* The actual start time of a traffic delay can sometimes differ from the recorded start time. The recorded start time refers to when support services first receive the incident report. Due to the current legacy manual system for incident reporting and monitoring, the end time is optional and is sometimes not documented in the database, adding to the complexity.
* The total number of incident categories could exceed 20, given that definitions have evolved over the past decade. However, for this study, we focus on testing LLMs against 14 distinct scenarios: Faulty Vehicles, Acute Track Damages, Acute Switch Damages, Overhead Line Faults, Signal Faults, Rescue Operations, Police Interventions, Fire Brigade Interventions, Illegal Parking, Traffic Accidents, Demonstrations, Events, Delays, and Other Incidents.
